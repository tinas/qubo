# Qubo Playground

This directory contains example code and test scenarios for the Qubo library. It's a great place to:
- Try out different query patterns
- Test new features
- Experiment with custom operators
- Learn how to use the library

## Directory Structure

- `/examples`: Contains example TypeScript files demonstrating various use cases
  - `basic-usage.ts`: Basic examples of filtering and querying

## Running Examples

To run any example:

```bash
# First build the library
npm run build

# Then run the example using ts-node
npx ts-node playground/examples/basic-usage.ts
```

Feel free to modify these examples or create new ones to test different scenarios!
